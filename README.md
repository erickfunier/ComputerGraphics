# Nested Tic-Tac-Toe
A classic game, with a hint of difficulty, the Nested Tic-Tac-Toe consists of nine Tic-Tac-Toe games that together form a Tic-Tac-Toe, increasing the difficulty, since any of the games can be done simultaneously, with a distraction the player loses easily.

The code was made using the ABCg library, with OpenGL, the menu, and the buttons on each board were made with ImGui and the lines and columns, in addition to the end-of-game trace, were made with Open graphics.

For each board in the game, an ImGui window is created, which makes it a lot easier, as these windows are generated with just a few for loops.

The description of the positions of each board is made in the file openglwindow.hpp and the description and creation of the graphics are in the files shapes.cpp and shapes.hpp.

The game can be access in web version:
